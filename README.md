# Techmap Starter

## Usage
The tech map starter kit uses [Harp](https://harpjs.com/) for local development, so first you'll need to make sure you have Harp installed.

```
npm install -g harp
```

Once you have Harp installed, you can initialize a new Harp project using the `--boilerplate` option.

```
harp init myproject --boilerplate rootinc/techmap-starter
```

And that's it, you're ready to start development on your next tech map project! :tada:


## Development

To contribute to the Techmap Starter, begin by cloning the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/rootinc/techmap-starter.git
```
