# module-core

### Setup the module core as a subtree:
```
git remote add -f module-core git@github.com:rootinc/module-core.git
```
### Intermediate step: 
```
  you need to delete the shared folder that already exists
  in the repo you are creating, before you add the subtree files .
  Not doing this will result in the rest of the process not working correctly
```
### First time - add subtree files to repo
```
git subtree add --prefix (your path)/js/shared module-core master --squash
```

###Update module core:
```
git fetch module-core master
git subtree pull --prefix (your path)/js/shared module-core master --squash
```

###Push new changes to module core:
```
git subtree push --prefix (your path)/js/shared module-core master
```
##Building modules(build process could change, so I'll update as needed)
```
1. run grunt minify and build every module within the repo onn your local machine
2. making sure that dis folder of any new module is added to git ignore
2. run grunt push to send the module you want to gh-pages
3. When building final pacakges go to this link for projects:
http://marge.rootinc.tools/api/project/projectnumber/preloader/
and place this url with the other data marge urls. this will prevent flickering 
or loading in of images that can happen sometimes. 
(Note: project number will be the project number generated by marge, you don't have to place anything in that section)
```

##Important things to remember when building modules:
```
1.For Modules, make sure that any of the ID's aren't used as base properties in the project.
This will cause conflict with items in the module showing up correctly. 
2. marge generated html/css needs to be before any other css files you include, so that it is overwritten
```
